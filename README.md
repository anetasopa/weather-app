> I personally like to know what the weather will be like today or tomorrow, so that motivated me to write this short weather application.

It is an application that allows you to check the weather in any place in the world. It shows the **location**, **temperature** and **kind** of the weather in a given place 😃

### How does this app work? 🤔

You can open it by command:

```npm run start ```

There in the place of input you have to enter the place you want to search and click the button. After a while, the current weather will appear below.

### How was the application written? 🧐

I used the **React** library to write this application, because I wanted to experience writing such an applications in this library. This app is also mobile scalable where I used: **@media**. The weather content is downloaded from the API via 'key' and 'base', i.e. the content of the query referring to a given place.

### What have I learned? 💭

Writing this application taught me how to put simple and short API requests to get the right information and how React works. 

⁉️ **React** is a javascript library for building a UI (user interface), using small and pieces (components).
